In fact, many professors were invited to give the "Last Lecture" before leaving the lecture hall. At that time, they often shared about failures as well as the quintessence drawn from
individual life and career. While listening to the presentation, the audience is always tormented by the question:
If this is our last chance, what message can we send to everyone? If I have to leave tomorrow
What do we want to be the legacy to leave for life?

When Randy Pausch, Professor of Informatics teaching at Carnegie Mellon, was asked to give such a lecture,
he figured it would be his last lecture, because he had just been diagnosed with terminal cancer.
But his lecture - "Touching Childhood Dreams" - is not about death but about overcoming
obstacles, about spreading the way to realize dreams to others and never letting anything go to waste
any moment in life (because "Time is all you have. One day you will realize how little you have."
